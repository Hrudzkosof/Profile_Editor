### Author: Sofiia Hrudzko

## Project Overview

The **Profile Editor Application** provides an interactive interface for managing user profiles. It allows users to:
- Edit profile information.
- Upload and preview avatar images.
- Add and manage tags, potential interests, and external links.
- Upload and manage project and task files.

The application uses **React**, **Redux**, and **LocalStorage** for efficient state management and data persistence.

## Features

1. **Profile Management**:
   - Editable fields for name, lastname, job title, phone, email, address, and pitch.
   - Avatar upload with live preview.
   - Profile visibility toggle (Private or Public).

2. **Dynamic Tag Management**:
   - Add, edit, and delete interests and potential interests.
   - Persistent changes using `localStorage`.

3. **Link Management**:
   - Add and manage external links with site name and URL.
   - Persistent across sessions.

4. **File Uploading**:
   - Manage project and task files with metadata (name, size, type).
   - File lists dynamically updated on upload or removal.

5. **Persistent Data**:
   - All profile details, tags, links, and files are saved in `localStorage` and restored on page reload.

6. **Modular Architecture**:
   - Centralized state management with **Redux**.
   - Efficient form handling using **react-hook-form**.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
